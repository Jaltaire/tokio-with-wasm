//! A collection of tasks spawned in JavaScript runtime.
//!
//! This module provides the [`JoinSet`] type, a collection which stores a set
//! of spawned tasks and allows asynchronously awaiting the output of those
//! tasks as they complete. See the documentation for the [`JoinSet`] type for
//! details.
